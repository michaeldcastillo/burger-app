# burger-app

### Project Description

This project is intended to demonstrate a basic Create Read Update Delete (CRUD) web application. In this example, the app is a "full-stack" JavaScript application. This site uses a "hamburgers" theme to provide the basis for interacting with the app.

Technologies used in this app include the following:

* JavaScript - As a "back-end" programming language
* Node.js - JavaScript runtime providing the app's execution environment and command line interface
* mysql (package) - Node package used to interface with the database
* MySQL (database) - Relational Database Management System (RDMS) administered using MySQL Workbench
* Express.js (package) - Node package used to create a web server
* Heroku - Web hosting platform

### Accessing the Application

* ???

### User Experience Assumptions

* Starter "burger" data is provided for the user and displayed on page load. Users can add their own "burger" data (no specific validation implemented). Users can only "devour" a burger, not "undevour" it.
